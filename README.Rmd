### How to cite

Please cite this compendium as:

> Marwick, B., L. Wang, R. Robinson, H. Loiselle, (`r format(Sys.Date(), "%Y")`). _Compendium of R code and data for "`r Title`"_. Accessed `r format(Sys.Date(), "%d %b %Y")`. Online at <https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/DBSW9>

## Contents

The **analysis** directory contains:  

- [:file_folder: paper](/analysis/paper): R Markdown source document for manuscript. Includes code to reproduce the figures and tables generated by the analysis. It also has a rendered version, `paper.docx`, suitable for reading (the code is replaced by figures and tables in this file)    
- [:file_folder: data](/analysis/data): Data used in the analysis.  
- [:file_folder: figures](/analysis/figures): Plots and other illustrations

## How to run in your broswer or download and run locally

The simplest way to explore the text, code and data is to click on [binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/benmarwick/replicationteachingarchaeology/master?urlpath=rstudio) to open an instance of RStudio in your browser, which will have the compendium files ready to work with. Binder uses rocker-project.org Docker images to ensure a consistent and reproducible computational environment. These Docker images can also be used locally.

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL: [master.zip](/archive/master.zip). After unzipping, open the `Proj` file in RStudio, and run `devtools::install()` to ensure you have the packages this analysis depends on (also listed in the [DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file). Then open `paper.Rmd` and knit to produce the `paper.docx`.
